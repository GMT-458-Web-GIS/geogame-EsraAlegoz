  ## Game Features and Requirements

- **Objective**:  The player follows quests to find hidden treasures scattered around the world map and earns points for completing each quest.
- **Treasure Locations**: There are treasures placed in different locations on the map. Each treasure is located in a different location.
- **Quests and Puzzles**:  A task is defined for each treasure. When the task is completed, points are earned and the player progresses.
- **Point System and Abilities**:  Each treasure carries a point value. Points represent the player's progress, and players who reach certain points will discover the pattern formed on the map.
- Leaflet.js library was used to provide map functionality for this project.

## Frontend Layout

- Header:
The title of the game, "Lost Treasures of the World".

- Map Area:
Shows the world map centered on Turkey and there are markers at the locations of the missions.
The map focuses on the location related to each new mission.

- Score Panel:
Shows the player's current score and the number of missions they have completed.
Points are updated as each mission is completed and increased according to the number of treasures.

- Guess Input:
A pop-up opens when the marker is clicked and a question is asked to the player.
After the player enters their answer to the question, it is checked whether it is correct or incorrect.

- Feedback Popup:
If the player's answer is correct, the message "Mission completed!" is displayed.
If an incorrect answer is given, the message "Wrong answer! Try again." is displayed.


Note: You can guess the shape 3 times until the game time ends. If the tasks are completed just before the time ends, the shape will appear.
