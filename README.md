 ## Game Features and Requirements

- **Objective**:  The player follows quests to find hidden treasures scattered around the world map and earns points for completing each quest.
- **Treasure Locations**: There are treasures placed in different locations on the map. Each treasure is located in a different location.
- **Quests and Puzzles**:  A task is defined for each treasure. When the task is completed, points are earned and the player progresses.
- **Point System and Abilities**:  Each treasure carries a point value. Points represent the player's progress, and players who reach certain points will discover the pattern formed on the map.
- Leaflet.js library was used to provide map functionality for this project.
